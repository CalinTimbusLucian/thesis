# The thesis contains an approach to detect and classify traffic signs.
# While the detection consists of an OpenCV approach, the latter was implemented completely by means of deep learning.
# The photo "Dovada" shows the usage of the detection algorithm in the centre of Cluj-Napoca.
# withoutConvexHull + withConvexHull demonstrates the need of applying the convexHull after drawing the contours.
