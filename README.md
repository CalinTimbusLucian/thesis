# The thesis contains an approach to detect and classify traffic signs.
 While the detection consists of an OpenCV approach, the latter was implemented completely by means of deep learning.

 The photo "Dovada" shows the usage of the detection algorithm in the centre of Cluj-Napoca.
 
 WithoutConvexHull + withConvexHull photos demonstrate the need of applying the convexHull after drawing the contours.

 Capture.PNG contains the proof of the results on the training set and on the validation set.
 
 cnn_couple_final and licenta_couple_final are the final versions of the classification and the detection modules respectively.
 
 The photos example(1)...example(n) represent the output of the entire algorithm(detection and classification module working together) applied in traffic scenes.
